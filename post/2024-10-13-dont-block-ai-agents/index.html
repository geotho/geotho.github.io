scrape, steal, and reproduce content. There&rsquo;s no value is showing them ads,
because their behaviour was pre-programmed and they didn&rsquo;t have money to spend.</p><p>But this isn&rsquo;t true for general-purpose web-browsing AI agents.</p><p>An AI agent&rsquo;s behaviour is not fixed. Rather, they are able to react to the
content on a website. Advanced agents are able to remember facts for next time,
potentially longer than a human could. Adverts for AI may prove to be more
effective than adverts for human users.</p><p>Less interesting questions to be asking:</p><ul><li>how do we invent harder captchas that humans can solve and AI can&rsquo;t?</li><li>how do we prevent non-human users from using our sites?</li></ul><p>More interesting questions to be asking:</p><ul><li>why are we blocking bots at all?</li><li>how can I optimise advertising for AI users?</li><li>how can I otherwise monetise AI users?</li></ul><p>The industry will be market-led: if it becomes far more profitable to serve AI
agents than to block them, we&rsquo;d expect permissive websites to win eventually.</p><p>But to find out, we have to give AI agents a chance.</p></article></body></html>
