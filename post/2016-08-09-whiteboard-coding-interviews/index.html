stack of some companies. Candidates should not fear it as much as many do. I&rsquo;d
like to outline my rationale below.</p><h3 id=why-interview>Why interview?</h3><p>Hiring is a classification problem, and interviewing is one part of the classifier. The outputs are &ldquo;should hire&rdquo; and &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t hire&rdquo;.</p><p>Like all classification problems, in hiring one must make a tradeoff between
precision and recall, between false positives (hiring someone who shouldn&rsquo;t
be hired) and false negatives (not hiring someone who should be hired).</p><p>It is trivial to design hiring processes that minimise false positives (hire
no one) or that minimise false negatives (hire everyone).</p><p>In practice, there are many types of hiring processes that appear:</p><ul><li>Take-home technical tasks</li><li>Quizzes</li><li>Chatting about previous work</li><li>Questions about systems design</li><li>Pair programming</li><li>Open-source code contributions</li></ul><p>All these hiring processes make tradeoffs between precision and recall. How
do whiteboard coding interviews make that tradeoff?</p><h3 id=why-whiteboard-coding>Why whiteboard coding?</h3><p>Whiteboard coding interviews are one of the better methods of preventing
false positives: it is very difficult to pass the interview if you aren&rsquo;t capable of doing the job.</p><p>Google, Facebook and others rely on whiteboard coding interviews for this reason: they want to avoid bad hires.</p><p>They do this even if it means they miss out on good hires. And they do. In 2009, Facebook rejected a candidate called Brian Acton. In 2014, they bought his company, WhatsApp, for $19bn.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook can afford to miss out on some good hires, because of the quantity and quality of the applications they get.</p><p>If you are a smaller company, or one that doesn&rsquo;t get the quantity or quality of applications that the likes of Google or Facebook get, you are in a more difficult position. Hiring the wrong person is bad, but so is missing out on the right person.</p><h3 id=what-to-do-about-whiteboard-coding>What to do about whiteboard coding</h3><p>Don&rsquo;t let whiteboard coding interviews put you off applying for a particular role. If they do successfully put you off, I&rsquo;d argue they are doing their job correctly.</p><h4 id=practise>Practise</h4><p>Whiteboard coding interviews, like any other technical interviews, can be
practised. I&rsquo;d argue that it would be a better use of time to practise
whiteboard coding as opposed to e.g. behavioural questions.</p><p>Many sites like <a href=https://careercup.com/>CareerCup</a>,
<a href=https://www.hackerrank.com/>HackerRank</a> and
<a href=http://www.spoj.com/>Sphere Online Judge</a> post questions very similar to
those asked in interviews. The questions often draw from a small set of
Computer Science theory.</p></article></body></html>
