These assess a few different areas, including:</p><ul><li>extracting concrete requirements from loose specifications;</li><li>estimations;</li><li>making tradeoffs between different technologies or requirements;</li><li>knowledge of different subsystems (cloud platforms, container orchestrators, queuing systems&mldr;);</li><li>ability to produce a feasible design that meets business requirements.</li></ul><h2 id=why-do-i-need-a-structured-approach->Why do I need a structured approach? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2><p>Unlike coding interviews, system design interviews benefit much more
from a structured approach. A structured approach will ensure:</p><ul><li>you feel confident in yourself, and thus appear confident to your interviewer;</li><li>you demonstrate knowledge across all the axes your interviewer cares about;</li><li>you are likely to produce a high-coverage design
(one that handles all the requirements);</li><li>interviewers are expecting you to lead the discussion, which is difficult to
do if you don&rsquo;t have a structure.</li></ul><h2 id=a-structured-approach-for-system-design-interviews->A structured approach for system design interviews üóº</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s a high-level approach. I&rsquo;ll go into each area separately:</p><ol><li>Analyse requirements</li><li>Approximate quantitatively</li><li>Design data stores</li><li>Produce high-level architecture</li><li>Dive-deep into problem specifics</li><li>Consider tradeoffs</li><li>Map back to the original requirements</li></ol><h3 id=1-analyse-requirements->1. Analyse requirements ‚úçüèº</h3><p>A system design question might be something like &ldquo;design WhatsApp&rdquo; or
&ldquo;design YouTube&rdquo; or &ldquo;design bicycle hire&rdquo;. It is impossible to cover all
the features of those systems in the 40~60 minutes you&rsquo;ll have.</p><p>Instead, spend some time precisely defining the scope of your solution.
Think about the core user stories when interacting with the app.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Question</th><th>Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&ldquo;Design YouTube&rdquo;</td><td><ul><li>Upload videos</li><li>Watch video</li><li>Browse videos</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;Design bicycle hire&rdquo;</td><td><ul><li>Hire bicycle</li><li>Return bicycle</li><li>Find bicycles</li><li>Journey billing</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Make sure that somewhere on your whiteboard / Google Drawing you&rsquo;ve itemised a
list of requirements.</p><p>Ensure you ask your interviewer if there are any additional requirements they&rsquo;d
like you to cover that you may have missed.</p><h3 id=2-approximate-quantitatively->2. Approximate quantitatively üî¢</h3><p>Next, produce some &ldquo;back of the envelop&rdquo; calculations.</p><p>You want to produce approximations for numbers like:</p><ul><li>how many monthly active users (MAU) your service might have;</li><li>how many queries per second (QPS) you might have to serve;</li><li>how much bandwidth your service might require;</li><li>how the quantity of data you store might grow over time;</li><li>how many machines you might require to meet the desired bandwidth / QPS.</li></ul><p>Some useful rules and numbers to know are:</p><ul><li><a href=http://brenocon.com/dean_perf.html>&ldquo;Jeff Dean&rsquo;s Numbers Everyone Should Know&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)>1% rule: 99% of users are lurkers</a></li><li>There are 86 400 seconds in a day.</li></ul><h3 id=3-design-data-stores->3. Design data stores üíæ</h3><p>What data are you going to store, and how you are going to store it?</p><p>Things you&rsquo;ll want to consider:</p><ul><li>How much data are we storing?</li><li>How frequently will we need to read or write the data?</li><li>Is the data structured or unstructured?</li><li>How might we need to search or index the data?</li><li>How does the data vary in size or format?</li><li>What availability and consistency guarantees do we want to provide?</li></ul><p>Some reoccuring areas you&rsquo;ll want to consider:</p><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem>CAP theorem</a> ‚Äî how do you trade off consistency against availability?</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use>Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU)</a></li><li><a href=https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/read-your-writes>Read your writes consistency</a></li></ul><h3 id=4-produce-high-level-architecture->4. Produce high-level architecture üó∫</h3><p>Your requirements analysis should state your data sources, and your data store design tells you where your data lives. Your high-level architecture connects
these together.</p><p>Produce a diagram with your sources (or clients) on the left, and your sinks
somewhere on the right. Then fill in the middle with whatever servers, load balancers, computer clusters, queuing systems etc. you might need.</p><p>You might want to consider:</p><ul><li>your application code execution environment;</li><li>what parts of your system need to run synchronously (i.e. within the lifetime
of a request) and which can be run asynchronously;</li><li>whether you need batch or nightly jobs, and how you might execute those;</li></ul><p>At a minimum you&rsquo;ll probably have:</p><ul><li>Some horizontally scalable group of application servers (e.g. AWS EC2 ASGs, or Kubernetes Pods)</li><li>A load balancer to distribute requests between your application servers</li></ul><p>Then you might want to add things depending on your requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>queuing systems</strong> for message passing or
asynchronous processing like RabbitMQ, Kafka or Kinesis;</li><li><strong>blob stores</strong>, like S3;</li><li><strong>SQL databases</strong>, like Postgres, MySQL or SQL Server;</li><li>Horizontally scalable <strong>NoSQL databases</strong>, like DynamoDB, BigTable, or Cassandra</li><li><strong>Caches</strong>, like Redis or memcached;</li><li>High availability <strong>config stores</strong>, like ZooKeeper or etcd;</li><li><strong>Analytics databases</strong> like BigQuery or Redshift;</li><li><strong>Search servers</strong> like ElasticSearch or Solr.</li></ul><p>Only mention technologies where you understand the tradeoffs they make. Unless
you explicitly say something like &ldquo;I would investigate X as I have never used it
directly&rdquo;. <strong>Don&rsquo;t just name drop technologies that you think will sound smart</strong>.</p><p>You will also want to talk about the interfaces between each of your components.
Will you use raw TCP or UDP, or HTTP, or gRPC, or Thrift?
What schemas / message bodies do you use?</p><h3 id=5-deep-dive-into-problem-specific-issues->5. Deep-dive into problem-specific issues üß∞</h3><p>Here is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the technical
or business problems that might arise in your system, and how you deal with them.</p><p>Some generic issues are things like:</p><ul><li>How would you scale the system to serve more requests?</li><li>What are the load characteristics of the system? Do you have hot keys when
e.g. a video goes viral? How do you deal with spiky load?</li><li>How might the system break? Where are your single-point-of-failures?</li></ul><p>Your specific system might have particular issues:</p><ul><li>Video platform<ul><li>Illegal content</li><li>Copywrite infringement</li><li>Duplicate videos</li></ul></li><li>Messaging systems<ul><li>Privacy</li><li>Abuse and blocking</li></ul></li><li>Payments systems<ul><li>Handling PII and SPII</li><li>Certifications e.g. ISO27001</li><li>KYC and AML checks (and OFAC lists and SDN lists and&mldr;)</li></ul></li></ul><p>You should volunteer any problems you can think of to your interviewer.
Part of the assessment criteria will be your ability to anticipate and mitigate
potential future risks.</p><h3 id=6-consider-tradeoffs->6. Consider tradeoffs ‚öñÔ∏è</h3><p>There are probably other systems you could have designed that would have
met your requirements. How else could you have designed the system? What would
have changed?</p><p>For example, you might suggest NoSQL vs SQL data stores. But that might impact
data consistency because you might lack database transactions.</p><p>Or you might suggest asynchronous rather than synchronous processing, but now you
need an email server to notify users when their job is done.</p><h3 id=7-map-back-to-the-original-requirements->7. Map back to the original requirements üèÜ</h3><p>Finally, read over your initial requirements and briefly note how your design
meets them.</p><h2 id=common-misconceptions->Common misconceptions üé≠</h2><p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll like to go over some common misconceptions of people doing system
design interviews.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never used {Redis, BigQuery, RabbitMQ, &mldr;} so I will do badly at system design interviews.</p></blockquote><p>Though system design interviews are assessing the breadth of your knowledge,
that&rsquo;s only one axis. There are plenty of other factors at play, and the
approach as suggested with help you expose them to the best of your ability.</p><blockquote><p>Coding interviews require less preparation than system design interviews</p></blockquote><p>I think both require adequate preparation. I also think system design is much
more difficult to prepare for, because there&rsquo;s no automated test suite available
to validate your design.</p><h2 id=conclusion->Conclusion üîö</h2><p>System design interviews are a great way to demonstrate your experience.
Use them to highlight your breadth of knowledge, business accumen and
ability to anticpate and mitigate failure.</p><p>These skills are more difficult to assess than coding, so use a structured
approach like the one presented above to maximise your chance of success.</p></article></body></html>
