[Strava](https://strava.com) is a website for tracking your athletic activity.
I recently wanted to find a ride from a year or so ago.

I went to my profile page, and saw this:

![Strava profile page]({{site.baseurl}}/images/display-less-stuff/1.png)

It's not obvious how to get to rides before September 2015.

Clicking the drop down menu, I saw this:

"Why can I only select from the last three weeks of rides?" I thought to myself. But then I realised. This _is_ the year selector.

Why doesn't it look like a year selector? Because it shares exactly the same formatting as the week selector in the header:

![Strava header]({{site.baseurl}}/images/display-less-stuff/3.png)


How can they make it more obvious that this is in fact the year selector? By displaying only the part users care about: the year.
