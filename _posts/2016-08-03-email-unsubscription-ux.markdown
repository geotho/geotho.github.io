Put the 'unsubscribe from all emails' button at the top of the email settings page.

I hope this screenshot, courtesy of the Medium unsubscription page, goes some way to explaining why:

You could have saved me seven clicks. You could have put 'unsubscribe all' above the fold. Alas.

Users who end up on your 'unsubscribe' pages are already irritated by the quantity (or perhaps quality) of emails you've sent â€” avoid irritating them further by making the process more difficult than it need be.
