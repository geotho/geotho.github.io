I'm George.

You can get in contact with me at `<firstname>tamayo<lastname>@gmail.com`.

I like: puzzles, cycling, maths, rock climbing, art and design and eating.

#### For students and schools

I often run workshops for GCSE or A-Level computing and maths students, or
bright sixth-form students interested in studying something science-y at
university.

Some previous topics include:
  - my work or internships (e.g. at Google)
  - my time at school and university
  - Oxbridge application and interview guidance

Particularly with Oxbridge application prep, I hope I am pretty well informed:
I spent a year as an access officer, delivering presentations on the application
process and running mock interviews.

I do this for free if the school is a state-funded comprehensive.
Otherwise, rates are negotiable.

#### For charities

If you are a charity who needs help with websites or IT, please contact me. If I
can help, and believe the cause is just, and you aren't well funded then I'll
help for free.
