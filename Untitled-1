It's early Saturday morning and the sky is thicker than usual. It makes me feel like I live in a snowglobe.

I do my best writing on trains. I do my best everything on trains. There's something relaxing about leaving the city behind, and knowing there's nothing you have to do, nothing you can do, to affect the journey. I don't feel the same about planes. Planes are too exciting, and there is nothing to look at.

I feel sorry for the people whose bedroom windows I'm looking into, whose mornings I've disrupted. But they're probably used to it, and I can only assume the mortgage is cheaper as a result. They should be thanking me.
